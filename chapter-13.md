# THIRTEEN (173): In [the den]() of tigers, the Gold Star brings deliverance at Double-Fork Ridge, Boqin detains the monk
```
The rich Tang ruler issued a decree,
Deputing Xuanzang to seek the source of Chan.
He bent his mind to find the Dragon Den.
With firm resolve to climd the Vulture Peak.
Through how many states did he roam beyoud his own?
Through cloud and hills he passed then thousand times.
He now leaves the throne go to the West.
He'll keep law and fairth to reach the Great Void.
```
We shall now tell about Tripitaka, who, on the third day before the fifteenth of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of the period Zhenguan, was send off by the Tang emperor and many officials from outside the gate of Chang'an. For the couple of days his horse trotted without seasing, and soon they reached the Temple of the Law Gate. The abbot of that temple led some five hundred monks on both sides to recive him and took him inside. As they met, tea was served, after which a vegertian meal was presented.

Soon after meal, dusk fell, and thus
```
Shadows moved to the Star River's nearing pulse;
The moon was bright without a speck of dust
The wild geese called from the distant sky,
and washing flails beat form nearby homes.
As birds returned to perch on withered tress,
the chan monks convensed in their Sanskrit tones.
On rush mats placed upon a sight bunk.
They sat until haflway through the night.
```
Beneath the lamps the various monks discussed Buddhist doctrines and the purpose of the seeking scriptures in the Western Heaven.

Some pointed out that the waters were wide and the mountains very high, others mentioned that the roads were crowded with tighers and leopards, still others maintained that the precipitous peaks were difficult to scale; and another group insisted that the vicious monsters were har to subdue. Tripitaka, however, keep his mouth shut tightly, but he pointed his fingers to his heart and nodded his head several times. Not preceiving what he meant, the various monks folder their hands and asked: "Why did the Master of the Law point to his heart and nod his head"<br>
"When the mind is active"<br>
Tripitaka replied:  "all kind of mara come into existence"; when the mind is extinguished, all kind of mara existinguished, This disciple has already made an important vow before Buddha in the Temple of Transformation, and he has no alternative but to fulfill it with whole heart. If I go, I shall not aside until I have readed the Western Heaven, seen Buddha, and acquired the scriptures so that the Wheel of the Law will returned to us and kingdom of our lord will be secured forever." When the various monks hear this statement, everyone congratulated and commended him, saying "A loyal and valiant master!" They praised (ca tụng) him unseasingly as they escorted(hộ tống) him to bed. Soon
```
The bamboos trucks down the setting moon
And the cock crowed to gather the clouds of dawn.
```
The various monks arose and prepared some tea and morning meal. Xuanzang put on his cassock(cáo cà sa) and went to worship Buddha in the main hall. "Your disciple, Chen Xuanzang" he said, "is on his way to seek scripture in the Western Heaven. But my fleshly eyes are dim unperceptive and do not regonize the true form of the living Buddha. Now I wish to make a vow: that throughout this journey I shall burn incense whenever I come upon a temple, I shall worship Buddha whenever I meed a Buddha, and I shall sweep pagoda whenever I reach a pagoda. May our Buddha be merciful and reveal to me his Diamond body sixteen feet tall. May he grant me the true scriptures so that may be reserved in the land of the east."

He finished his prayer and went back to the hall for the vegetarian meal, after which his two attendants made ready the saddle and urged him to begin his journey. Going out the temple's gate. Tripitaka leave the monks, who grieved to see him go. They accompained him for ten miles before turning back, tears in their eyes, as Tripitaka proceeded directly toward the West. It was the time of late autumn. You see
```
Trees growing bare in hamlets as rush petals break;
From every maple column the red leaves fall;
trikkers through paths of mist and rain are few.
The fair chrysanthemuns,
The sharp mountain rock,
Cold streams and creakd lilies all make one sad.
snow fall from a frosty sky on rushes and reeds.
One duck at duck descends in the distant void.
Clouds o'er the wilds through the gathering gloom.
The shallows depart;
The wild geese apear
Their cires, though loud, are halting and forlorn.
```
After traveling on several days, master and disciples arrived at the city of Gongzhou. They were met at once by the various municipal officials of that city, where they spent the night. The next morning they set off againt, taking food and drink along the way, resting by night and journeying by day. In two or three days, they arrived at the District of Hezhou, which formed the border of the Great Tang Empire. When the garrison commander of the border as well as the local monks and priests heard that the Master of the Law, a bond brother of emperor, was on his way to the Western Heaven to see the Buddha by royal commision, they received the travelers with due revenrence. Some chief priests then invited them to spend the night at Fuyuan Temple, where every resident cleric came to pay respect to the pilgrims. Dinner was served, after which the two attendants were told to feed the hourses well, for the Master wanted to leave before dawn. At the first crowing of the cock, he called his attendans and aroused the monks of that temple. They hastened to prepare tea and breakfash, after which the polgrims departed from the border.

Because he was somewhat impatient to get going, the Master arose a trifle too early. The fact is that this was late autumn, when cocks crow rather early-at about the time of the fourth watch. Facing the clear frost and the bright moon, the tree of them(the horse made up the fourth member of the team) journeyred for some twenty and thirty miles, when they came upon a mountain range. It soon became exceedingly difficult for them to find theirs way. As they had to poke around in the grass to look for a path, they began worried that they might heading in the wrong direction. In that very anxious moment, they suddenly tripped; all three of them as well as the hours tumbled into a deep pit. Tripitaka was terrified; his companion all shock with fear. They were still trembling when they heard voices shouding, "Seize them, Seize them".

A violent wind swept by, and a mod of fifty and sixty ogres appeared, who seized Tripitaka with his companions and hauled them out of the pit. Quivering and shivering, the Master of the Law stole a glance around and saw a ferosious Monster King seated up on high. Truly he had
```
a figure most awesomely bold,
a face most disincly fiece.
Light flashed from his lightinglike eyes;
All quacked at his thunderous voice.
His sawlike teeth jutted outward.
Like fangs they emerged from his jaws.
Brocade wrapped his body around.
and coiling stripes covered his spine.
they saw flesh through sparse, steely whiskers.
Keen-ediged were his claws like sharp swords.
Even Huang Gong of Easet Sea would fear.
This white-brwd King of mountain South
```
Tripitaka was so frinterned that his spirit left him, while the bones of his followers grew weak and their tendons turned numb.

The Monster King shouted for them to be bound, and the various orges tied up all three of them with ropes. They were begin prepared to be eaten when a clamor was heard outside the camp. Someone came in to report: "The Bear Mountain Lord and the Steer Hermit have arrived."

Hearing this, Tripitake looked up. The first one to come in was a swarthy fellow. "How did he look?" you ask:
```
He seemed valiant and couragerous,
with body both tough and brawny.
his great streangh could for the waters.
he prowled the woods, flaunting his power.
Ever a good omen in dream.
he showed now his forceful features.
He could break or blimb the green trees.
And predicted when winter was near.
Truly he was most clever
Hence Mountain Lord was his name.
```
Following behind him was another husky fellow. "How did he look?" You ask.
```
a cap of twin horns rugged
And a humback most majestic
His green robe showed his calm nature,
He walked with a slumberous gait
He came from a father named Bull;
His mother's proper name was Cow;
A great boon to people who plowed
He was thus called the Steer hermit
```

The two of them swaggered in, and the Monster King hurried out to receive them. The Bear Mountain Lord said, "You are in top form, General Yin. Congratulations! Congratulations!"

"General Yin look better than ever, said the Steer hermit". "It's marvelous! It's maverlous!"

"And you two gentelement, how have you been these days?" asked the Monsters King "Just maintaining my idleness" said the Mountain Lord. "Just keeping up with the times," said the Hermit After these exchanges, they set down to chat some more.

Meanwhile, one of Tripitaka's attendants was bound so tightly that he began to moan pitifully. "How did threse three get here?" asked the swarthy fellow. "They practically present themselves at the door!" said the Monster King. "Can they used for the guests' dinner?" asked the Hermit, laughing. "By all means!" said the monster King. "Let's not finish them all up", said the mountain Lord.<br>
"We'll dine on two of them and leave one over."<br>

The monster King agreed. He called his subodinates at onece to have the attendants eviscerated and theirs carcasses carved up, their heads, hearts, and livers were to be presented to the guests. the limbs to the host, and the remaining portions ò flesh and bone to the rét ò the orges. The moment the order was given, the orges pounced on the attendants like tigers preying on sheep: munching and crunching, they devoured them in no time at all, The priest nearly died for fear, for this, you see, was his first bitter ordeal since his depature from Chang'an.

As he was nursing his horror, light began to grow in the east. The two monsters did not retier until dawn. Saying "We Are beholden to your generous hospitality today" Permit us to repay in kind in another time" they left together. Soon the sun rose high in the sky, but Tripitaka was still in a stupor, unable to discern which way was the north, south, east, or west. In that half-death condition, he suddenly saw an old man approaching, holding a staff in his hands. Walking up to Triptaka, the man waved his hands and all the ropes snapped. He then blew on Tripitaka, and the monk began to revive. Falling on the ground, he said: "I thank the aged father for saving my life of this poor monk!"

"Get up" the old man said, returning his salure, "Have you lost anything?"

"The followers of your poor moonk" said Tripitaka, "have been eaten by the monsters. I have no ideal where my horse is or my luggage"

"Isn't that your horse over there with the two bundles?" asked the old man pointed with his staff. Tripitake turned around and discovered that his belongings had indeed remained untouched. Somewhat relieved, he asked the old man "Aged father, what is this place? How do happen to be here?"

"This called the Double-Fork Rigde, the place infested with tigers and wolves. How did you manage to get here?"
