# THIRTEEN: In [the den](#the-den) of tigers, the Gold Star brings [deliverance](#deliverance) at Double-Fork Ridge, Boqin [detains](#detain) the monk
```
The rich Tang ruler issued a decree,
Deputing Xuanzang to seek the source of Chan.
He bent his mind to find the Dragon Den.
With firm resolve to climd the Vulture Peak.
Through how many states did he roam beyoud his own?
Through cloud and hills he passed then thousand times.
He now leaves the throne go to the West.
He'll keep law and fairth to reach the Great Void.
```
We shall now tell about Tripitaka, who, on the third day before the fifteenth of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of the period Zhenguan, was send off by the Tang emperor and many officials from outside the gate of Chang'an. For the couple of days his horse trotted without seasing, and soon they reached the Temple of the Law Gate. The abbot of that temple led some five hundred monks on both sides to recive him and took him inside. As they met, tea was served, after which a vegertian meal was presented.

Soon after meal, dusk fell, and thus
```
Shadows moved to the Star River's nearing pulse;
The moon was bright without a speck of dust
The wild geese called from the distant sky,
and washing flails beat form nearby homes.
As birds returned to perch on withered tress,
the chan monks convensed in their Sanskrit tones.
On rush mats placed upon a sight bunk.
They sat until haflway through the night.
```
Beneath the lamps the various monks discussed Buddhist doctrines and the purpose of the seeking scriptures in the Western Heaven.

Some pointed out that the waters were wide and the mountains very high, others mentioned that the roads were crowded with tighers and leopards, still others maintained that the precipitous peaks were difficult to scale; and another group insisted that the vicious monsters were har to subdue. Tripitaka, however, keep his mouth shut tightly, but he pointed his fingers to his heart and nodded his head several times. Not preceiving what he meant, the various monks folder their hands and asked: "Why did the Master of the Law point to his heart and nod his head"<br>
"When the mind is active"<br>
Tripitaka replied:  "all kind of mara come into existence"; when the mind is extinguished, all kind of mara existinguished, This disciple has already made an important vow before Buddha in the Temple of Transformation, and he has no alternative but to fulfill it with whole heart. If I go, I shall not aside until I have readed the Western Heaven, seen Buddha, and acquired the scriptures so that the Wheel of the Law will returned to us and kingdom of our lord will be secured forever." When the various monks hear this statement, everyone congratulated and commended him, saying "A loyal and valiant master!" They praised (ca tụng) him unseasingly as they escorted(hộ tống) him to bed.

The bamboos trucks down the setting moon
And the cock crowed to gather the clouds of dawn.
```
The various monks arose and prepared some tea and morning meal. Xuanzang put on his cassock(cáo cà sa) and went to worship Buddha in the main hall. "Your disciple, Chen Xuanzang" he said, "is on his way to seek scripture in the Western Heaven. But my fleshly eyes are dim unperceptive and do not regonize the true form of the living Buddha. Now I wish to make a vow: that throughout this journey I shall burn incense whenever I come upon a temple, I shall worship Buddha whenever I meed a Buddha, and I shall sweep pagoda whenever I reach a pagoda. May our Buddha be merciful and reveal to me his Diamond body sixteen feet tall. May he grant me the true scriptures so that may be reserved in the land of the east."

He finished his prayer and went back to the hall for the vegetarian meal, after which his two attendants made ready the saddle and urged him to begin his journey. Going out the temple's gate. Tripitaka leave the monks, who grieved to see him go. They accompained him for ten miles before turning back, tears in their eyes, as Tripitaka proceeded directly toward the West. It was the time of late autumn. You see
```
Trees growing bare in hamlets as rush petals break;
From every maple column the red leaves fall;
trikkers through paths of mist and rain are few.
The fair chrysanthemuns,
The sharp mountain rock,
Cold streams and creakd lilies all make one sad.
snow fall from a frosty sky on rushes and reeds.
One duck at duck descends in the distant void.
Clouds o'er the wilds through the gathering gloom.
The shallows depart;
The wild geese apear
Their cires, though loud, are halting and forlorn.
```
After traveling on several days, master and disciples arrived at the city of Gongzhou. They were met at once by the various municipal officials of that city, where they spent the night. The next morning they set off againt, taking food and drink along the way, resting by night and journeying by day. In two or three days, they arrived at the District of Hezhou, which formed the border of the Great Tang Empire. When the garrison commander of the border as well as the local monks and priests heard that the Master of the Law, a bond brother of emperor, was on his way to the Western Heaven to see the Buddha by royal commision, they received the travelers with due revenrence. Some chief priests then invited them to spend the night at Fuyuan Temple, where every resident cleric came to pay respect to the pilgrims. Dinner was served, after which the two attendants were told to feed the hourses well, for the Master wanted to leave before dawn. At the first crowing of the cock, he called his attendans and aroused the monks of that temple. They hastened to prepare tea and breakfash, after which the polgrims departed from the border.

Because he was somewhat impatient to get going, the Master arose a trifle too early. The fact is that this was late autumn, when cocks crow rather early-at about the time of the fourth watch. Facing the clear frost and the bright moon, the tree of them(the horse made up the fourth member of the team) journeyred for some twenty and thirty miles, when they came upon a mountain range. It soon became exceedingly difficult for them to find theirs way. As they had to poke around in the grass to look for a path, they began worried that they might heading in the wrong direction. In that very anxious moment, they suddenly tripped; all three of them as well as the hours tumbled into a deep pit. Tripitaka was terrified; his companion all shock with fear. They were still trembling when they heard voices shouding, "Seize them, Seize them".

A violent wind swept by, and a mod of fifty and sixty ogres appeared, who seized Tripitaka with his companions and hauled them out of the pit. Quivering and shivering, the Master of the Law stole a glance around and saw a ferosious Monster King seated up on high. Truly he had
```
a figure most awesomely bold,
a face most disincly fiece.
Light flashed from his lightinglike eyes;
All quacked at his thunderous voice.
His sawlike teeth jutted outward.
Like fangs they emerged from his jaws.
Brocade wrapped his body around.
and coiling stripes covered his spine.
they saw flesh through sparse, steely whiskers.
Keen-ediged were his claws like sharp swords.
Even Huang Gong of Easet Sea would fear.
This white-brwd King of mountain South
```
Tripitaka was so frinterned that his spirit left him, while the bones of his followers grew weak and their tendons turned numb.

The Monster King shouted for them to be bound, and the various orges tied up all three of them with ropes. They were begin prepared to be eaten when a clamor was heard outside the camp. Someone came in to report: "The Bear Mountain Lord and the Steer Hermit have arrived."

Hearing this, Tripitake looked up. The first one to come in was a swarthy fellow. "How did he look?" you ask:
```
He seemed valiant and couragerous,
with body both tough and brawny.
his great streangh could for the waters.
he prowled the woods, flaunting his power.
Ever a good omen in dream.
he showed now his forceful features.
He could break or blimb the green trees.
And predicted when winter was near.
Truly he was most clever
Hence Mountain Lord was his name.
```
Following behind him was another husky fellow. "How did he look?" You ask.
```
a cap of twin horns rugged
And a humback most majestic
His green robe showed his calm nature,
He walked with a slumberous gait
He came from a father named Bull;
His mother's proper name was Cow;
A great boon to people who plowed
He was thus called the Steer hermit
```

The two of them swaggered in, and the Monster King hurried out to receive them. The Bear Mountain Lord said, "You are in top form, General Yin. Congratulations! Congratulations!"

"General Yin look better than ever, said the Steer hermit". "It's marvelous! It's maverlous!"

"And you two gentelement, how have you been these days?" asked the Monsters King "Just maintaining my idleness" said the Mountain Lord. "Just keeping up with the times," said the Hermit After these exchanges, they set down to chat some more.

Meanwhile, one of Tripitaka's attendants was bound so tightly that he began to moan pitifully. "How did threse three get here?" asked the swarthy fellow. "They practically present themselves at the door!" said the Monster King. "Can they used for the guests' dinner?" asked the Hermit, laughing. "By all means!" said the monster King. "Let's not finish them all up", said the mountain Lord.<br>
"We'll dine on two of them and leave one over."<br>

The monster King agreed. He called his subodinates at onece to have the attendants eviscerated and theirs carcasses carved up, their heads, hearts, and livers were to be presented to the guests. the limbs to the host, and the remaining portions ò flesh and bone to the rét ò the orges. The moment the order was given, the orges pounced on the attendants like tigers preying on sheep: munching and crunching, they devoured them in no time at all, The priest nearly died for fear, for this, you see, was his first bitter ordeal since his depature from Chang'an.

As he was nursing his horror, light began to grow in the east. The two monsters did not retier until dawn. Saying "We Are beholden to your generous hospitality today" Permit us to repay in kind in another time" they left together. Soon the sun rose high in the sky, but Tripitaka was still in a stupor, unable to discern which way was the north, south, east, or west. In that half-death condition, he suddenly saw an old man approaching, holding a staff in his hands. Walking up to Triptaka, the man waved his hands and all the ropes snapped. He then blew on Tripitaka, and the monk began to revive. Falling on the ground, he said: "I thank the aged father for saving my life of this poor monk!"

"Get up" the old man said, returning his salure, "Have you lost anything?"

"The followers of your poor moonk" said Tripitaka, "have been eaten by the monsters. I have no ideal where my horse is or my luggage"

"Isn't that your horse over there with the two bundles?" asked the old man pointed with his staff. Tripitake turned around and discovered that his belongings had indeed remained untouched. Somewhat relieved, he asked the old man "Aged father, what is this place? How do happen to be here?"

"This called the Double-Fork Rigde, the place infested with tigers and wolves. How did you manage to get here?"

"At the first cow of the cock" said Tripitaka, "Your poor monk left the District of Hezou. Little did I realize that we had risen to early and we lost our way tramping through fog and dew. We came upon this Monster King so exceedingly ferocious that he captured me and my two followers. There was also a swarthy fellow called the Bear Mountain Lord and a husky fellow called the streer hermit. They arrived and addressed the Monster King as General Yin. All three of them devoured my two followers and retired only at drawn. I have no ideal where I accrued the fortune and remit that caused the aged father rescue me here"

"That Steer Hermit", said the old man, "Is a wild bull spirit; The Mountain Lord, a bear spirit; and General Yin, a tiger spirit. The various orges are all demons of mountains and trees, spirits of strange beasts and wolves. Because of the primal purity of your nature, they cannot devour you. Follow me now and I shall lead you on your way."

Tripitaka could not be more thankful. Fastening the bundles on the saddle and leading his horse. He followed the old man out of the fit and walked toward the main road. He tied the horse to the buhses beside the part and turned to thank the aged father. At that moment a gentle breeze swept by, and the old man rose into the air and left, riding on a white crane with a crimson head. As the wind subsided. a slip of paper fluturred down. with four lines of verse written on it:
```
I am the Planet Vernus on the West
Who came to save you by special request
Some pupils divine become to your aid.
Blame not scriptures for handships ahead
```
when Tripitaka read this, he bowed toward the sky saying "I thank the gold star for seeing me through this ordeal".

After that, he lead his horse again on his lonley and melancholy journey, On this ridge truly you have:
```
Cold and soughing, the wind of the rainforest;
Purling and gurgling, the water of the brooklets;
Fragrant and musky, wildflowers in bloom;
In clutters and clumps, rough rocks piled high;
Chattering and clattering, the apes and the deer;
In rank and file, the musk and the fallow deer.
Chirping and cooing, birds frequently call.
Silent and still, not one man is in sight.
That master
Shivers and quivers to his anxious mind.
This dear horse,
Scared and nervous, can barely raise his legs
```
Ready to abandon his body and sacrifice his life, Tripitaka started up that rugged mountain. He journeyed for half a day, but not a single human being or dwelling was in sight. He was gnawed by hunger and disheartened by the rough road. In that desperate moment, he saw two fierce tigers growling in front of him and several huge snakes circling behind him; vicious creatures appeared on his left and strange beasts on his right. As he was all by himself, Tripitaka had little alternative but to submit himself to the will of Heaven. As if to complete his helplessness, his horse's back was sagging and its legs were buckling; it went to its knees and soon lay protrate on the ground. He could budge it beating or by tugging. With hardly an inch of space to stand on, our Master of the Law was in the depth of despair, thinking that certant death would be his fate. We can tell you however, that though he was in danger, help was on its way. For just as he though he was about to expire, the vicious creatures began to scatter and the monstrous beasts fled. the fierce tigers vanished and the huge snakes disappeared. When Tripitaka looked further ahead. he saw a man comming over the mountain slope with the steel trident in his hands and bow and arrows at his waits. He was ineed a valiant figure! Look at him:
```
He had on his head a cap
Of leopard skin, spotted and artemisia white;
He wore on his body a robe
Of lamb‟s wool with dark silk brocade.
Around his waist was tied a lion king belt,
And on his feet he wore tall boots of suede.
His eyes would bulge like those of someone hung.
His beard curled wildly like a fierce god‟s!
A bow and poisoned arrows hung on him.
He held a huge trident of finest steel.
His voice like thunder appalled mountain cats,
And wild pheasants quaked at his truculence
```
When Tripitaka saw him draw near, he knelf the side of the path and called out, his hand clapsed in front of him, "Great King save me, Great King, save me!"

The fellow came up to Tripitaka and put down his trident, rasing of the monk with his hands, he said: "Don't be afaird, Elder, I'm not a wicker man. I'm just a hunter living in this mountain, my sure name is Li and my given name is Boqin. I also go by the nickname of Senior Gruardian of the Mountain, I came here to find animals to eat, not expecting to run into you. I hope I didn't scare you."

"Your poor monk" said Tripitaka, "is a cleric who had seen by his Majesty, the Tang Emperor, to seek scripture from Buddha in the Western Heaven. When I arrived here a moments ago, I was surrounded by tigers, wolfs, and snakes so that, I could not procced. But when the creatures saw you comming they all scattered. and you had thus saved my life. Many thanks, Many thanks"

"Since I live here and my livelihood depends on killing tigers and wolves" said Boquid, "or catching a few snakes or reptiles" I usualy frighten the wild beasts away. If you have come from the Tang Emprie, you are actualy a native here, for this is still Tang territory and I am Tang subject. You and I both live off the land belonging to the emperor so that we are in truth citizens of the same nation, Dont be afraid. Follow me, You may rest your horse at my place, I shall see you off the morning.  

Tripikata was filled with the delight when he heard these words, and he led his horse to follow the hunter.

They passed the slope, and again heard the howling of the wind, "sit there, Elder" said Boqin and don't move, The sound of that wind tell me that a mountain cat is appraching. I'll take him home so that I can make a meal of him for you." when Tripitaka heard this, his heart hammered and his gall quivered and he became rooted to the ground, Grapsing his trident, that Guardiant strode forward and came face to face with a great striped tigers, Seeing Boqin, he turned and fled. Like a crack of thunder, the Guardian bellowed, "Cursed beast! Where will you flee"

When the tiger saw him pressing near, he turned with flailing claws to spring at him, only to be met by the Guardian with uplifted trident. Tripitaka was so terrified that he lay paralyzed on the grass. Since leaving his mother's belly, when had he ever witnessed such violent and dangerous goings-on? The Guardian went after that tiger to the foot of the slope, and it was a magnificent battle between man and beast. You see
Raging resentment, And churning whirlwind.
In raging resentment
The potent Guardian‟s hair pushed up his cap;
Like churning whirlwind
The striped prince belched dust, displaying his might.
This one bared its teeth and wielded its paws;
That one stepped sideways, yet turning to fight.
The trident reached skyward, reflecting the sun.
The striped tail stirred up both fog and cloud.
This one stabbed madly at the breast of his foe;
That one, facing him would swallow him whole.
Stay away and you may live out your years.
Join the fray and you‟ll meet Yama, the king!
You hear the roar of the striped prince
And the harsh cries of the Guardian.
The roar of the striped prince
Shook mountains and streams to frighten birds and beasts;
The harsh cries of the Guardian
Unlocked the Heavens to make the stars appear.
The gold eyeballs of this one protruded,
And wrath burst from the bold heart of that one.
Lovable was Liu the Mountain Guardian;
Praiseworthy was this king of the wild beasts.
So tiger and man fought, each craving life—
A little slower, and one forfeits his soul!
The two of them fought for about an hour, and as the paws of the tiger began to
slow and his torso to slacken, he was downed by the Guardian‟s trident stabbing him
through the chest. A pitiful sight it was! The points of the trident pierced the heart, and
at once the ground was covered with blood.
The Guardian then dragged the beast by the ear up the road. What a man! He
hardly panted, nor did his face change color. He said to Tripitaka, "We‟re lucky! We‟re
lucky! This mountain cat should be sufficient for a day‟s food for the elder."
Applauding him unceasingly, Tripitaka said, "The Guardian is truly a mountain
god!"
"What ability do I have," said Boqin, "that I merit such acclaim? This is really
the good fortune of the father. Let‟s go. I‟d like to skin him quickly so that I can cook
some of his meat to entertain you."
180

He held the trident in one hand and dragged the tiger with the other, leading the
way while Tripitaka followed him with his horse. They walked together past the slope
and all at once came upon a mountain village, in front of which were
Old trees soaring skyward,
Roads filled with wild creepers.
In countless canyons the wind was cool;
On many ridges came strange sounds and sights.
One path‟s wild blooms, their scent clung to one‟s body;
A few poles of bamboo, what enduring green!
The portal of grass,
The wattle-fenced yard—
A picture to paint or sketch.
The stone-slab bridge,
The white-earth walls—
How charming indeed, and rare!
Now in the wistful face of autumn,
The air was cool and brisk,
By the wayside yellow leaves fell;
Over the peaks the white clouds drifted.
In thinly-grown woods the wild fowls twittered,
And young dogs yelped outside the village gate.
When Boqin reached the door of his house, he threw down the dead tiger and
called, "Little ones, where are you?" Out came three or four houseboys, all looking
rather unattractive and mean, who hauled the tiger inside. Boqin told them to skin it
quickly and prepare it for the guest. He then turned around to welcome Tripitaka into
his dwelling, and as they greeted each other, Tripitaka thanked him again for the great
favor of saving his life. "We are fellow countrymen," said Boqin, "and there‟s little
need for you to thank me."
After they had sat down and drunk tea, an old woman with someone who
appeared to be her daughter-in-law came out to greet Tripitaka.
"This is my mother, and this my wife," said Boqin. "Pray ask your parent to take
the honored seat," said Tripitaka, "and let your poor monk pay his respects."
"Father is a guest coming from great distance," said the old woman. "Please
relax and don‟t stand on ceremony."
"Mother," said Boqin, "he has been sent by the Tang emperor to seek scriptures
from Buddha in the Western Heaven. He met your son just now at the ridge. Since we
are fellow countrymen, I invited him to the house to rest his horse. Tomorrow I shall see
him on his way." When she heard these words, the old woman was very pleased.
"Good! Good! Good!" she said. "The timing couldn‟t be better, even if we had planned
to invite him. For tomorrow happens to be the anniversary of your late father‟s death.
Let us invite the elder to perform some good deeds and recite an appropriate passage of
scripture. We shall see him off day after tomorrow."
Although he was a tiger slayer, a so-called "Guardian of the Mountain," our Liu
Boqin had a good deal of filial feeling for his mother. When he heard what she said, he
immediately wanted to prepare the incense and the paper money, so that Tripitaka might
be asked to stay.
181
181
As they talked, the sky began to darken. The servants brought chairs and a table
and set out several dishes of well-cooked tiger meat, steaming hot. Boqin invited
Tripitaka to begin, telling him that rice would follow. "O dear!" said Tripitaka, his
hands folded. "To tell you the truth, I have been a monk since leaving my mother‟s
womb, and I have never eaten any meat."
Hearing this, Boqin reflected awhile. He then said, "Elder, for generations this
humble family has never kept a vegetarian diet. We could, I suppose, find some bamboo
shoots and wood ears and prepare some dried vegetables and bean cakes, but they
would all be cooked with the fat of deer or tigers. Even our pots and pans are greasesoaked! What am I to do? I must ask the elder‟s pardon."
"Don‟t fret," said Tripitaka. "Enjoy the food yourself. Even if I were not to eat
for three or four days, I could bear the hunger. But I dare not break the dietary
commandment."
"Suppose you starve to death," said Boqin, "what then?"
"I am indebted to the Heavenly kindness of the Guardian," said Tripitaka, "for
saving me from the packs of tigers and wolves. Starving to death is better than being
food for a tiger." When Boqin‟s mother heard this, she cried, "Son, stop such idle talk
with the elder. Let me prepare a vegetarian dish to serve him."
"Where would you get such a dish?" said Boqin. "Never mind. I‟ll fix it," said
his mother. She asked her daughter-in-law to take down a small cooking pan and heat it
until much of the grease had burned off. They washed and scrubbed the pan again and
again and then put it back on the stove and boiled some water in it. Taking some elm
leaves from the mountain, they made soup with it, after which they cooked some rice
with yellow millet mixed with Indian corn. They also prepared two bowls of dried
vegetables and brought it all out to the table. "Elder," the aged mother said to Tripitaka,
"please have some. This is the cleanest and purest food that my daughter-inlaw and I
have ever prepared."
Tripitaka left his seat to thank her before sitting down again. Boqin removed
himself to another place; dishes and bowls full of unsauced and unsalted tiger meat,
musk deer meat, serpent meat, fox flesh, rabbit, and strips of cured venison were set
before him. To keep Tripitaka company, he sat down and was about to pick up his
chopsticks when he saw Tripitaka fold his hands and begin to recite something. Startled,
Boqin dared not touch his chopsticks; he jumped up instead and stood to one side.
Having uttered no more than a few phrases, Tripitaka said to him, "Please eat."
"You are a priest who likes to recite short scriptures," said Boqin. "That was not
scripture," said Tripitaka, "only a prayer to be said before meals."
"You people who leave your families," said Boqin, "are particular about
everything! Even for a meal you have to mumble something!"
They ate their dinner and the dishes and bowls were taken away. Evening was
setting in when Boqin led Tripitaka out of the main hall to go for a walk at the back of
the dwelling. They passed through a corridor and arrived at a straw shed. Pushing open
the door, they walked inside, where they found several heavy bows and some quivers of
arrows hanging on the walls. Two pieces of tiger skin, stinking and bloodstained, were
draped over the cross beams, and a number of spears, knives, tridents, and rods were
stuck into the ground at one corner. There were two seats in the middle of the shed, and
Boqin invited Tripitaka to sit for a moment. Seeing that the place was so gruesome and
182
182
putrid, Tripitaka dared not linger. They soon left the shed and walked further back to a
huge garden, where there seemed to be no end of thick clumps of chrysanthemum piling
their gold and stands of maple hoisting their crimson. With a loud rustle, more than a
dozen fat deer and a large herd of musk deer jumped out. Calm and mild-mannered,
they were not at all frightened at the sight of human beings. Tripitaka said, "You must
have tamed these animals."
"Like the people in your city of Chang‟an," said Boqin, "where the affluent store
up wealth and treasures and the landlords gather rice and grain, so we hunters must keep
some of these wild beasts to prepare against dark days. That‟s all!"
As they walked and conversed, it grew dark, and they returned to the house to
rest. As soon as the members of the family, young and old, arose next morning, they
went to prepare vegetarian food to serve to the priest, who was then asked to begin his
recitations. Having first washed his hands, the priest went to the ancestral hall with the
Guardian to burn incense. Only after he had bowed to the house shrine did Tripitaka
beat on his wooden fish and recite first the true sentences for the purification of the
mouth, and then the divine formula for the purification of mind and body. He went on to
the Sūtra
for the Salvation of the Dead, after which Boqin requested him to compose in
writing a specific prayer for the deliverance of the deceased. He then took up the
Diamond Sūtra and the Guanyin Sūtra, each of which was given a loud and clear
recitation. After lunch, he recited several sections from the Lotus Sūtra and the
Amitāyus Sūtra, before finishing with the Peacock Sūtra and a brief recounting of the
story of Buddha healing a bhikṣu.
Soon it was evening again. All kinds of incense were burned together with the
various paper horses, images of the deities, and the prayer for the deliverance of the
deceased. The Buddhist service was thus completed, and each person retired.
We shall now tell you about the soul of Boqin‟s father, verily a ghost redeemed
from perdition, who came to his own house and appeared to all the members of his
family in a dream. "It was difficult," he said, "for me to escape my bitter ordeals in the
Region of Darkness, and for a long time I could not attain salvation. Fortunately, the
holy monk‟s recitations have now expiated my sins. King Yama has ordered someone to
send me to the rich land of China, where I may assume my next incarnation in a noble
family. All of you, therefore, must take care to thank the elder, and see that you are not
negligent in any way. Now I leave you." So it is that
There is, in all things, a solemn purpose:
To save the dead from perdition and pain.
When the whole family awoke from the dream, the sun was already rising in the
east. The wife of Boqin said, "Guardian, I dreamed last night that father came to the
house. He said that it was difficult for him to escape his bitter ordeals in the Region of
Darkness, and that for a long time he could not attain salvation. Fortunately, the holy
monk‟s recitations have now expiated his sins, and King Yama has ordered someone to
send him to the rich land of China where he may assume his next incarnation in a noble
family. He told us to take care to thank the elder and not be negligent in any way. After
he had finished speaking, he drifted away, despite my plea for him to stay. I woke up
and it was all a dream!"
"I had a dream also," said Boqin, "one exactly like yours! Let‟s get up and talk
to mother about this."
183
183
The two of them were about to do so when they heard the old mother calling,
"Boqin, come here. I want to talk to you."
They went in and found the mother sitting up in bed. "Son," she said, "I had a
happy dream last night. I dreamed that your father came to the house saying that, thanks
to the redemptive work of the elder, his sins had been expiated. He is on his way to the
rich land of China, where he will assume his next incarnation in a noble family."
Husband and wife laughed uproariously.
Boqin said, "Your daughter-in-law and I both had this dream, and we were just
coming to tell you. Little did we expect that mother‟s call also had to do with this
dream."
They therefore called on every member of the family to express their gratitude
and prepare the monk‟s horse for travel. They came bowing before the priest and said,
"We thank the elder for providing life and deliverance for our deceased father, for
which we can never repay you sufficiently."
"What has this poor monk accomplished," said Tripitaka, "that merits such
gratitude?"
Boqin gave a thorough account of the dream that the three of them had, and
Tripitaka was also very pleased. A vegetarian meal was again served, and a tael of silver
was presented as a token of their gratitude.
Tripitaka refused to accept so much as a penny, though the whole family begged
him earnestly. He only said, "If, in compassion, you can escort me on the first part of
my way, I shall ever be grateful for such kindness."
Boqin and his mother and wife had little alternative but hastily to prepare some
biscuits from unrefined flour, which Tripitaka was glad to accept. Boqin was told to
escort him as far as possible. Obeying his mother‟s bidding, the Guardian also ordered
several houseboys to join them, each bringing hunting equipment and weapons. They
walked to the main road, and there seemed to be no end to the scenic splendor of the
mountains and peaks.
When they had traveled for half a day, they came upon a huge mountain so tall
and rugged that it truly seemed to touch the blue sky.
In a little while the whole company reached the foot of the mountain, and the
Guardian began to ascend it as if he were walking on level ground. Halfway up, Boqin
turned around and stood still at the side of the road, saying, "Elder, please go on
yourself. I must now take leave of you and turn back." When Tripitaka heard these
words, he rolled down from his saddle and said, "I beg you to escort me a little further."
"You do not realize, Elder," said Boqin, "that this mountain is called the
Mountain of Two Frontiers; the eastern half belongs to our Great Tang domain, but the
western half is the territory of the Tartars. The tigers and wolves over there are not my
subjects, nor should I cross the border. You must proceed by yourself."
Tripitaka became fearful; he stretched out his hands and clutched at the sleeves of the hunter, tears pouring from his eyes.
It was at this tender moment of farewell that there came from beneath the mountain a thunderous voice crying, "My master has come! My master has come!"

Tripitaka was dumbfounded, and Boqin trembled. We do not know who was crying; let's listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
