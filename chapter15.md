# FIFTEEN:<br>*At Serpent Coil Mountain, the gods give secret protection<br> At the Eagle Grief Stream, the Horse of the Will is reined*

We were telling about Pilgrim, who ministered to the Tang monk faithfully as they advanced toward the West. They traveled for several days under the frigid sky of midwinter; a cold wind blew fiercely and slippery icicles hung everywhere. They traversed:
*
A tortuous path of hanging gorges and cliffs,
A parlous range tiered with summits and peaks.
*

As Tripitaka was riding along on his horse, his ears caught the distant sound of a torrent. He turned to ask:

"Where is that sound comming from?" Pilgrim said, "the name of this place, I recall, is Serpent Coil Mountain, and there is an Eagle Grief Stream in it."

"I suppose that is where it's comming from."

Before they had finised their conversation, they arrived at the bank of the stream, Tripitaka renied in his horse and looked around, He saw:

*A bubbling cold stream piercing through the clouds,
Its limpid current reddened by the sun.
Its splatter in night rain stirs quiet vales;
Its colors glow at dawn to fill the air.
Wave after wave seems like flying chips of jade,
Their deep roar resonant as the clear wind.
It flows to join one vast stretch of smoke and tide,
Where gulls are lost with egrets but no fishers bide.*

Master and dispile were looking at the stream, when there was a lound splash in midstream and a dragond emerged. Churning the waters, it darted toward the bank and headed straight for the priest. Pilgrim was so startled that he threw away the luggage, hauled the master off his horse, and turned to flee with him at once. Dragond could not catch up with them, but it swallowed the white horse, harness and all, with one gulp before losing itself again in water. Pilgrim carried his master to high ground and left the priest seated there, then he returned to fetch the horse and lugage. The load of bags was still there, but the horse was nowhere to be seen. Placing the luggage in front of his master, he said, "Master, there is not a trace of that cursed dragon, which has frightened away our horse."

"Disiple" said Tripitaka, "how can we find the horse again?"

"Relax, Relax" said Pilgrim, "Let me go and take a look."

He wishtled once and leaped up into the air. Shading his fiery eye and diamond pupils with his hand, he peered in all four direction, but there was not the slighest trace of the horse. Dropping down from the clouds, he made his report, saying "Master, our horse must have been eaten by that dragon. It's nowhere to be seen."

"Disiple," said Tripitaka, "how big a mouth does creature have that he can swallow a horse, harness and all? It must have been frightened away instead, propaly still running lost somewhere in the valley. Please take another look", Pilgrim said, "You really have no conception of my ability. This pair of eyes of mine in daylight can discern good and evil within a thousand miles; at that distance, I can even see a dragonfly when it spreads its wings. How can I possibly miss something as big as a horse?"

"If it has been eaten," Tripitaka said, "How am I to proceed? Pity me, How can I walk through those thousand hills and ten thousand waters.

As he spoke, tears began to fall like rain, when Pilgrim saw him crying he became infuirated and began shout:

"Master stop behaving like a namby-pamby! Sit here! Just sit here! Let old monkey find that creature and ask him to give us back our horse. That'll be the and of matter."

Clutching at him, Tripitaka said, "Disciple, where do you have to go to find him? Wouldn"t I be hurt if he should appear from somewhere after you are gone? How would it be then if both man and horse should perish?"

At these words, Pilgrim became even more enranged, "You're weakling! Truly a weakling," he thundered, "Yon want a horse to ride on, and yet you won't let me go. You want to sit here and grow old, watching our bags?"

As he was yelling angrily like this, he heard someone calling out in midair.

"Great Sage Sun, don't be annoyed. and stop crying, Loyal brother of Tang. We are a brand of deities sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin to give secret protection of scripture pilgrim."


Hearing this, the priest hastily bowed to the ground. "Which divinites are you?" asked Pilgrim,  "Tell me your name, so I can check you off the roll."

"Were are Six gods of darkness and six gods of Light" they said, "the Guardians of five poins, the Four Sentinels, and the Eighteen Protectors of Monasteries. Everyone of us waits upon you in rotation."


"Which one of you will begin today?" asked Pilgrim, "The gods of darkness and Light" they said, "to be followed by the Sentinels and the Protectors. We Guarndian of Five points, with the exception of the Golden-Headed Guardian, will be here somewhere day and night."


"That's being the case," Pilgrim said, "those not on tudy may retire, but the first Gods of darkness, the day Sentiels, and the Guardian should remain to protect my master. Let old monkey go find that cursed dragond in the stream and ask him for our horse." 

The various deities obeyed, Only then did Tripitaka feel somewhat relieved as he sat on the cliff and told to Pilgrim to be carefull: "Just don't worry," said Pilgrim. Dear Monkey King, He tightened the belt  around his silk shirt, hitched up his tiger-skin kilt, and went staight forward the gorge of the stream holding the golden-hooped iron rod. Standing halfway between cloud and fog, he cired loudly on top of the water, "Lawless lizard!  return my horse!" We now telling about dragond, who, having eaten the white horse of Tripitaka, was lying on the bottom of the water of stream, subduing his spirit and nourishing his nature, He heared someone demanding the horse with abusive langluage, however, he could not restrain the fire leaping up in his heart and he jumped up pickly, Churning the water, he darted out of the water, saying, "Who dare to insult me here with his big mouth?" Pilgrim saw him and cried ferociously, "Don't run away, return my horse!", wieding his rod, he aimed at the beast's head and struck, while dragon attacked with open jaws and dancing claws, the battle between the two of them before the stream was ineeded fierce. You see:

*The dragon extending sharp daws:
The monkey lifting his rod.
The whiskers of this one hung like white jade threads;
The eyes of that one shone like red-gold lamps.
The mouth beneath the whiskers of that one belched colored mists:
The iron rod in the hands of this one moved like a fierce wind.
That one was a cursed son who brought his parents grief;
This one was a monster who defied the gods on high.
Both had to suffer because of their plight.
They now want to win, so each displays his might.*

Back and forth, round and round, they fought for a long time, until dragond grew weak and could fight no longer, He turned and darted into the water; plunging to the bottom of stream; he refused to come out again, the monkey king heaped insult upon insult, but the dragond pretended to be deaf.

Pilgrim had little choice but to return to Tripitaka, saying, "Master that monster made his appearance as a result of my tonglelasing. He fought with me for a long time before taking fright and running. He's hiding in the water now and refuses to come out again."

"Do you know of certain that it was he eate my horse", asked Tripitaka, "Listen the way you talk," said Pilgrim. "If he hadn't eaten it, would he be willing to face me and answer me like that?"

"The time you killed tiger." said Tripitaka, "You claims that you have ability to tame dragonds and subdue tigers. Why can't you subdue this one today."

As the monkey has a rather low tolerance for any kind of provocation, this single taunt of Tripitaka was so arounsed him that him said, "Not one word more! Let me go and show him how is master!" with great leaps, our monkey king bounded right the the edged of stream, using his magic of overturning seas and rivers, he tranformed the clear,  limpid water of the Eagle Grief Stream into a muddy currents of the Yellow River during high tide. the cursed dragond in the depth of stream could neither sit nor lie still for single moment. He thought to himself.

"Just as 'Blessing never repeats itself, so misfortune never comes sighly, It has been barely a year since I escape excution by Heaven and came to bide my time here, but now I have to run into this wretech monster who is trying to do me harm" look at him! The more he thought about the matter, the more inrateated he became. Unable to bear with any longer, he gritted his teeth and leaped out the water and crying, "What kind of monster are you, and where do you come from, what do you want to oppress me like this?" 

"Never mind where I come from," said Pilgrim, "Just return the horse and I'll spare your life."

"I've sallowed your horse into my stomach", said the dragond,  "so how am I to throw it up? What are you going to do if I can't return it to you?" Pilgrim said, "If you don't give me back the horse, just watch for this rod. Only when your life becomes a payment for my horse will there be an end of this matter"

The two of them again waged a bitter struggle below the mountain ridge. After a few rounds, however, the little dragon just could not hold out any longer; shaking his body, he changed himself into a tiny water snake and wriggled into the marshes. The monkey king came rushing up with his rod and parted the grass to look for the snake, but there was not a trace of it. He was so exaperated that the spirit of the Three Worms in his body explorded a smoke began began appear from his seven aperture. He deceited a spell begining with the letter om and summonted the local spirit and the mountain god of this region. the two of them knelt before, saying "The local spirit and mountain god have come to see you."

Stick out your shanks, said Pilgrim, "and I will greet each of you five strokes of my rob just to relive my feeling."

"Great Sage" they pleaded, "please be more lenient and allow your humble subjects to tell you something."

"What have you got to say", said Pilgrim, "The Great Sage has been in captivity a long time" said the two dieties, "and we had no knowleged of when you were released. That's why we have not in here to receive you, and we beg you to pardon us."

"All right", said Pilgrim, "I won't hit you. But let me ask you something, where did that mounstous dragond in the Eagle Grief Stream come form, and why did he devour my master's white horse?"

"We have never know the Great Sage to have a master" the two deities said, "for you have always been a first-rank primordial immortal who submits neither to Heaven nor to Earth. What do you mean by your master' horse?" Pilgrim said, "Of course you didn't know about this. Because of my contemputous behavior toward the Heaven, I had to suffer for this five hundred years. I was convented by the kindly persurea of Bohshivata Guanyin, who had the true monk from the Tang court resue me, As his dispile, I was to follow him to the Western Heaven to seek scriptures from Buddha, we passed throught this place, and my master's white horse was lost."

need for the Great Sage to get angrying trying to look for him. If you want to capture this creature. All you need do is to ask Guanshiyin to come here, then he'll certanly surrender. "When Pilgrim heard this, he called the mountain god and local spirit to go with him to see Tripitaka to give an account of what had happened. "If you need to send for the Bodshisattva" said Tripitaka, "when will you able return? How can this poor monk can endure with cold and hunger?"

He had hardly finished speaking when the Golden-Header Guardian called out from midair, "Great Sage, you needn't leave. Your humble subject will go fetch the Bodshisattva." Pilgrim very pleased, shouting. "Thanks for taking all that troubles! Go quickly!"

The Guardian mounted the clouds swiftly and headed straight for South Sea; Pilgrim asked the mountain god and the local spirit to protect his master and the Day Seitinal to find some vegetarian food, when he himself went back to patrol the stream, and we shall say no more of that.

We now tell about the Golden-Headed Guardian, who mounted the clounds and soon arrived at South Sea. Descending from the auspicious light, he went straight for the purple bamboo grove of the Potalaka Mountain when he asked the various deities in golden armor and Moksa to announce his arrival. The Bodshisattav said, "What have you come from?"

"The Tang monk lost his horse at the Eagle Grief Stream of the Serpent Coil Mountain" said the Guardian, "and the Great Sage Sun was placed in a terrible dilemman. He questined the local deities, who claimed that a dragond send by the Bodshisattva to that stream had eaten it. The Great Sage, therefore, send me to request Bodshisattva to go subdue that cursed dragon, so that he might get back his horse."

Hearding this, the Bodshisattva said, "That creature was originally the son of Aorun of the Western Ocean. Because in his carelessness he set fire to the palace and destroyed the luminous pearls hanging there, his father accused him at subversion, and he was condemented to die by the Heavenly Tribunal." It was I who personally sought pardon from the Jade Emperor for him, so that he might serve as a means of transportation for the Tang Monk. I can't undersand how he could swallowd the monk's horse instead. But if that is what happened. I'll have to get over there myself.

The Budshisattva left her lotus platform and get out of the divine cave. Mounting the auspicious luminosity with the Guardian, she crossed the South Sea. We
have a testimonial poem that says:

Buddha proclaimed the Tripitaka Supreme
Which the Goddess declared throughout Chang"an:
Those great, wondrous truths could reach Heaven and Earth;
Those wise, true words could save the spirits damned.
They caused Gold Cicada to cast again his shell.
They moved Xuanzang to mend his ways anew.
By blocking his path at Eagle Grief Stream,
A dragon-prince in horse-form returns to the Real.

The Bodshisattva and the Guardian have soon arrived at the Serpent Coil Mountain. They stopped the hallowed clouds in midair and saw Pilgrim Sun down below, shouting abuses at the bank of the stream, the Bodshisattva asked the Guardian fetch him. Lowering his clouds. the Guardian went past Tripitaka and headed straight for the edge of stream, saying to Pilgrim, "Bodhisattva has arrived" when Pilgrim heared this, he jumped quickly into the air and yelled at her:

"You, so-called Teacher of Seven Buddhas and the Founder of the Fair of Mercy! Why did you have used your tricks to harm me?"

"You impudent stableman, ignorant red-buttock!" said the Bodhisattva, "I went to considerable effort to find the scripture pilgrim, whom I careful instructed to save your life. instead of thanking me, you are finding fault with me?"

"You saved me all right!" said Pilgrim. "If you truly wanted to deliver me, you should have allowed me to have a little fun with no strings attached. When you met me the other day above the ocean, you could have chastened me with a few words, telling me to serve the Tang Monk with diligence, and that would have been enough. Why did you have to give him a flower cap, and have him deceive me into wearing it so that I would suffer? Now the fillet has taken root on old Monkey"s head. And you even taught him this so-called „Tight-Fillet Spell," which he recites again and again, causing endless pain in my head! You haven"t harmed me, indeed!"

The Bodhisattva laughed and said, "Oh, monkey! You are neither attentive to admotion nor willing to seek the fruit of truth. If you are not retrained like this, you'll probaly mock the authority of Heaven again without regard for good or ill. If you create troubles as you did before, who will be able to control you? It's only through this bit of adverity that you will be willing to enter our gate of Yoga."

"All right" said Pilgrim, "I'll consider the matter my hard luck. By why did you take that condemned dragon and send him here so that be could become a spirit and swallow my master's horse? It's your fault, you know, if you allow an evildoer to perpetrate his villaineise some more."

"I went personally to plead with the Jade Emperor", said the Bubhisattva, "the have the dragon stationed here so that he could served as a means of transportation for the scripture pilgrim. those mortal horses from the land of east, do you think that they could walk through ten thousand waters and a thousand hills? How could they possily hope to reach the spirit Mountain, the land of Buddha? Only a dragon-horse could make that journey!"

"But right now he is so terribly afraid of me" said Pilgrim, "that he fesure to come out of his hiding place, What can we do?"

The Bodhisattva said to the Guardian, "Go to the edge of stream and say, Come out, Third Prince Jade Dragon of the Dragon King Aorun. The Bodhisattve from South Sea is here", He'll come out then.

The Guardian went once to the edge of the stream and called out twice. Churning the water and leaping across the waves, the little dragond appeared and changed at once into the form at a man. He stepped on the clouds and rose up into the air, saluting the Bodhisattva, he said "I thank the Bodhisattva again for saving my life. I've waited here a long time, but I've never heared no new of the scripture pilgrim," Pointing to Pilgrim, the Bodhisattva said, "Isn't he the eldest disciple of the scripture pilgrim?" When he saw him, the little dragon said, "Bodhisattva, he's my adversary. I was hungry yesterday and ate his horse. We fought over that, but he took advantage of his superior strength and defeated me; in fact, he so abused me that I dared not show myself again. But he has never mentioned a word about scripture seeking." 

"You didn't brother to ask my name," said Pilgrim, "How did you expect me to tell you anything?"

The little dragond said, "Didn't I ask you,"
