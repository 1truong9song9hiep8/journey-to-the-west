# FIFTEEN:<br>*At Serpent Coil Mountain, the gods give secret protection<br> At the Eagle Grief Stream, the Horse of the Will is reined*

We were telling about Pilgrim, who ministered to the Tang monk faithfully as they advanced toward the West. They traveled for several days under the frigid sky of midwinter; a cold wind blew fiercely and slippery icicles hung everywhere. They traversed:
*
A tortuous path of hanging gorges and cliffs,
A parlous range tiered with summits and peaks.
*

As Tripitaka was riding along on his horse, his ears caught the distant sound of a torrent. He turned to ask:

"Where is that sound comming from?" Pilgrim said, "the name of this place, I recall, is Serpent Coil Mountain, and there is an Eagle Grief Stream in it."

"I suppose that is where it's comming from."

Before they had finised their conversation, they arrived at the bank of the stream, Tripitaka renied in his horse and looked around, He saw:

*A bubbling cold stream piercing through the clouds,
Its limpid current reddened by the sun.
Its splatter in night rain stirs quiet vales;
Its colors glow at dawn to fill the air.
Wave after wave seems like flying chips of jade,
Their deep roar resonant as the clear wind.
It flows to join one vast stretch of smoke and tide,
Where gulls are lost with egrets but no fishers bide.*

Master and dispile were looking at the stream, when there was a lound splash in midstream and a dragond emerged. Churning the waters, it darted toward the bank and headed straight for the priest. Pilgrim was so startled that he threw away the luggage, hauled the master off his horse, and turned to flee with him at once. Dragond could not catch up with them, but it swallowed the white horse, harness and all, with one gulp before losing itself again in water. Pilgrim carried his master to high ground and left the priest seated there, then he returned to fetch the horse and lugage. The load of bags was still there, but the horse was nowhere to be seen. Placing the luggage in front of his master, he said, "Master, there is not a trace of that cursed dragon, which has frightened away our horse."

"Disiple" said Tripitaka, "how can we find the horse again?"

"Relax, Relax" said Pilgrim, "Let me go and take a look."

He wishtled once and leaped up into the air. Shading his fiery eye and diamond pupils with his hand, he peered in all four direction, but there was not the slighest trace of the horse. Dropping down from the clouds, he made his report, saying "Master, our horse must have been eaten by that dragon. It's nowhere to be seen."

"Disiple," said Tripitaka, "how big a mouth does creature have that he can swallow a horse, harness and all? It must have been frightened away instead, propaly still running lost somewhere in the valley. Please take another look",
