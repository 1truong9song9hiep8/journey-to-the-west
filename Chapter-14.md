# Fourteen: Mind Monkey return to right, the six robbers [vanish from sight](#vanish-from-sight).
*Mind is the Buddha and the Buddha is Mind;<br>
Both Mind and Buddha are important things.<br>
If you perceive there‟s neither Mind nor Thing,<br> 
Yours is the dharmakāya of True Mind.<br> 
The dharmakāya<br> 
Has no shape or form:<br> 
One pearl-like radiance holding myriad things.<br>
The bodiless body is the body true,<br>
And real form is that form which has no form.<br>
There‟s no form, no void, no no-emptiness;<br>
No coming, no leaving, no pariṇāmanā; <br>
No contrast, no sameness, no being or nonbeing: <br>
No giving, no taking, no hopeful craving. <br>
Light efficacious is in and out the same. <br>
Buddha‟s whole realm is in a grain of sand. <br>
A grain of sand the chiliocosm holds; <br>
One mind or body‟s like ten thousand things.<br> 
To know this you must grasp the No-mind Spell; <br>
Unclogged and taintless is the karma pure. <br>
Don‟t do the many acts of good or ill: <br>
This is true submission to Śākyamuni.*

we were telling about Tripitaka and Boqin, who, in [fear and alarm](#fear-and-alarm), again heard the cry, "My Master has come!", The various houseboys said, "It must be the old ape in that stone box beneath the mountain who is shouting."

"It's he, It's he!", said the Guardian. Tripitaka asked, "Who is old ape?"

"[The ancient name](the-ancient-name) of this mountain", said Guardian, "was the mountain of Five Phases". It was changed to the Mountain of the Two Frontiers as a result of our Great Tang ruler's western campaigns to secure his [empire](#empire). A few years ago, I heard from my elder that during the time when [Wang Mang](wang-mang) [usurped](#usurp) the throne of the Han emperor, this mountain fell from Heaven with a divine monkey [clamped](#clamp) beneath it, He feared neither hot nor cold, and he took neither food nor drink. he have been watched and guarded by the spirit of Earth, who fed him iron balls when he was hungry and juice of bronze when he was thirsty. He has lasted from that time unitl now. Surviving both cold and hunger. He must be the one who is making all this noise. Don't be afraid, Elder. Let's go down the mountain to take a look."

Tripitaka has to agree and led his horse down the mountain, they has traveled only a few miles when they came upon the stone box in which where was ineeded a monkey who, with his head [sticking out](#strick-out), was waving his hands [wildly](#wildly) and crying, "Master, why have you take to long to take here? Welcome, Welcome! Get me out, I will protect you on your way to the Western Heaven."

The priest went forward to look more closely at him. "How does he look?" you ask.
*A pointed mounth and a hollow cheecks
Two diamond pupils and fyrie eyes
Lichens has piled on his head
wisteria grew in his ears
By his temples was more green grass than his hair
Beneath his chin, moss insead of a beard
with mug  on his brow
and earth in his nose
he looked most desperate
his fingers coarse
and calloused palms
were caked in filth and dirt!
luckily, his eyes could still roll about
And the apish tongue, articulate.
Though in speech he had great ease
His body he could not move
He was a Great Sage Sun five hundred years ago.
Today his ordeal end, he leaves Heaven's net.*

Undenialbly a courangerous person, that Guardian Liu went up to the creature and pulled away some of grass at his temples and some of moss beneath his chin. He asked "What do you say?"

"Nothing to you" said the monkey, "but ask that master to up come here. I have a question for him."

"What is your question?" asked Tripitaka, "Are you someone sent by the great king of the Land of the East to go seek the scripture in the Western Heaven" asked the monkey. “I am,” said Tripitaka. “Why do you ask?”

"I am the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven," said the Monkey, "who greatly distubed the Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago."

Because of my sin of rebellion and disobedience, I was imprisoned here by the Buddha. Some time ago, a certain Bodhisattva Guanyin had received the decree of Buddha to go to the Land of the East in quest of a scripture pilgrim. I asked her to give me some help, and she persuaded me not to engage again in violence. I was told to believe in the Law of Buddha and faithfully to protect the scripture pilgrim on his way to worship Buddha in the West, for there would be a goodly reward reserved for me when such merit is achieved. I have therefore been maintaining my vigilance night and day, waiting for the Master to come to rescue me. I‟m willing to protect you in your quest of scriptures and become your disciple.” When Tripitaka heard these words, he was filled with delight and said, “Though you have this good intention, thanks to the Bodhisattva‟s instruction, of entering our Buddhist fold, I have neither ax nor drill. How can I free you?” 

"No need for ax or drill" said the monkey "If you are willing to rescue me, I'll be able to get out"

Tripitaka said: "I'm willing, but how can you get out?"

On top of this mountain, said the monkey,  "there is a tag stamped with the golden letters of our Buddha Tathāgata. Go up there and left up the tag. Then I come out"

Tripitaka agreed and turned to Boqin, imploring him, "Guardian, come with me up to the mountain."

"Do you think he's speaking the truth", asked Boqin, "It's the truth", the monkey shouted, "I dare not lie".

Boqin had no choice but to call his houseboys to led the horses. He himself support the Tripitaka with his hands, and they started up the tall mountain. Trugging at screepers and vines, they final arrived at the highest peak, where they beheld ten thousand shafs of golden light and a thousand folds of hallowed air, threre was a huge square slab of stone, on which was tapped a seal with the golden letters, , Oṁ maṇi padme
hūṁ. Tripitaka approached the stone and knelt down. He looked the golen letters and kowtowed several time to the stone. Then, facing the West, h prayed.

"Your desiple, Chen XuangZang was specifically commanded to seek scriptures from you. If it is so odanied that he should be my disciple, let me lift up those golden letters so that the divine monkey may find release and join me at the Spirit Mountain. If he is not predestiend to be my disciple, if he only a cuel monster trying to deceive me and to bring misfortune to our enterprise let me not filf up this tape."

He kowtowed again after he had prayed. Going toward, with the greatest of ease he took down the golden letters. A fragrant wind swept by immediately and blew the tag out of his hand into the air as a voice called out "I am prison guardian of the Great Sage". Today his ordeal is completed, and my colleagues and I returning this seal to Tathāgata, Boqin, and their followers were so terrified that they fell on the ground and bowed toward the sky. They then descended from the tall mountain and came back to the stone box, saying to the monkey, "The tag has been fifted, You may comeout."

Delighted, the monkey said, "Master, you had better walk away from here so that I can come out. I don't want to frighten you." When Boqin heard this, he led Tribitaka and the rest of the company to walk back eastward for five or six miles. Again they heared the monkey yelling, "Further still, Further still", So Tripitaka and the others went still further until they had left the mountain. All at once came a crash so loud that it was as if the mountain was cracking and the earth splitting wide open; everyone was awestruck. The next moment the monkey was already in front of Tripitaka‟s horse; completely naked, he knelt down and cried, “Master, I‟m out!”
He bowed four times toward Tripitaka, and then, jumping up, he said to Boqin respectfully, “I thank Elder Brother for taking the trouble of escorting my master. I‟m grateful also for your shaving the grass from my face.” Having thanked him, he went at once to put the luggage in order so that it could be tied onto the horse‟s back. When the horse saw him, its torso slackened and its legs stiffened. In fear and trembling, it could hardly stand up. For you see, that monkey had been a Ban-Horse-Plague, who used to look after dragon horses in the celestial stables. His authority was such that horses of this world inevitably would fear him when they saw him.

When tripitaka saw that monkey was truly a person of good intentions, someone who truly resemble those who had embraced the Buddhist faith, he called to him, "Disciple, what is your surname?"

"My surname is Sun", said the monkey King, "Let me give you a religious name," said Tripitaka, "So that it will be convenient to address you."

"This noble thought of the master is deeply appreciated" said the Monkey King, "But I already have a religious name. I'm called Sun Wukong."

"It exactly fits the empainsis of our denomination," said the Tripitaka, delighted "But look at you, you look rather like a little dhūta, let me give you a nickname and call you Pilgrim Sun. How's that?"

"Good, Good!" said Wukong. So from then on, he was also called Pilgrim Sun.

When Beqin saw that Pilgrim Sun was definately preparing to leave, he turned to speak respectfully to Tripitaka, saying, "Elder, you are forturne to made an excellent disciple here. Congratulation, this person should be most fit to accompany you. I must take leave of you now"

Bowing to thank him, Tripitaka said, “I cannot thank you enough for all your kindness. Please be certain to thank your dear mother and wife when you return to your house. I have caused you all great inconvenience, and I shall thank you again on my way back.”

Boqin returned his salutation, and they parted.

We shall now tell about Pilgrim Sun, who asked Tripitaka to mount his horse, he himself, stark naked, carried luggage on his back and led the way. In a little while, as they were passing the Mountain of Two Frontiers, they saw the fierce tiger approaching, growling and waving its tall. Tripitaka, sitting on his horse, became alarmed, but Pilgrim, walking at aside of road, was delighted, "Dont be afraid, Master" he said, "for he's here to present me with some clothes."

He put down the luggage and took a tiny needle out of his ears. One wave of it facing the wind, and it became an iron rod with the thickness of a rice bowl. He held it in his hands and laughed, saying, “I haven‟t used this treasure for over five hundred years! Today I‟m taking it out to bag a little garment for myself.” Look at him! He strode right up to the tiger, crying, “Cursed beast! Where do you think you‟re going?” Crouching low, the tiger lay prone on the dust and dared not move. Pilgrim Sun aimed the rod at its head, and one stroke caused its brain to burst out like ten thousand red petals of peach blossoms, and the teeth to fly out like so many pieces of white jade. So terrified was our Chen Xuanzang that he fell off his horse. “O God! O God!” he cried, biting his fingers. “When Guardian Liu overcame that striped tiger the other day, he had to do battle with him for almost half a day. But without even fighting today, Sun Wukong reduces the tiger to pulp with one blow of his rod. How true is the saying, „For the strong, there‟s always someone stronger!‟” “Master,” said Pilgrim as he returned dragging the tiger, “sit down for awhile, and wait till I have stripped him of his clothes. When I put them on, we‟ll start off again.” “Where does he have any clothes?” asked Tripitaka. “Don‟t mind me, Master,”
said Pilgrim, “I have my own plan.” Dear Monkey King! He pulled off one strand of hair and blew a mouthful of magic breath onto it, crying, “Change!” It changed into a sharp, curved knife, with which he ripped open the tiger's chest. Slitting the skin straight down, he then ripped it off in one piece, he chopped away the paws and the head, cutting the skin into square piece, He picked up an tried.
