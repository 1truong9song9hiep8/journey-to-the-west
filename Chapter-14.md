# Fourteen: Mind Monkey return to right, the six robbers [vanish from sight](#vanish-from-sight).
*Mind is the Buddha and the Buddha is Mind;<br>
Both Mind and Buddha are important things.<br>
If you perceive there‟s neither Mind nor Thing,<br> 
Yours is the dharmakāya of True Mind.<br> 
The dharmakāya<br> 
Has no shape or form:<br> 
One pearl-like radiance holding myriad things.<br>
The bodiless body is the body true,<br>
And real form is that form which has no form.<br>
There‟s no form, no void, no no-emptiness;<br>
No coming, no leaving, no pariṇāmanā; <br>
No contrast, no sameness, no being or nonbeing: <br>
No giving, no taking, no hopeful craving. <br>
Light efficacious is in and out the same. <br>
Buddha‟s whole realm is in a grain of sand. <br>
A grain of sand the chiliocosm holds; <br>
One mind or body‟s like ten thousand things.<br> 
To know this you must grasp the No-mind Spell; <br>
Unclogged and taintless is the karma pure. <br>
Don‟t do the many acts of good or ill: <br>
This is true submission to Śākyamuni.*

we were telling about Tripitaka and Boqin, who, in [fear and alarm](#fear-and-alarm), again heard the cry, "My Master has come!", The various houseboys said, "It must be the old ape in that stone box beneath the mountain who is shouting."

"It's he, It's he!", said the Guardian. Tripitaka asked, "Who is old ape?"

"[The ancient name](the-ancient-name) of this mountain", said Guardian, "was the mountain of Five Phases". It was changed to the Mountain of the Two Frontiers as a result of our Great Tang ruler's western campaigns to secure his [empire](#empire). A few years ago, I heard from my elder that during the time when [Wang Mang](wang-mang) [usurped](#usurp) the throne of the Han emperor, this mountain fell from Heaven with a divine monkey [clamped](#clamp) beneath it, He feared neither hot nor cold, and he took neither food nor drink. he have been watched and guarded by the spirit of Earth, who fed him iron balls when he was hungry and juice of bronze when he was thirsty. He has lasted from that time unitl now. Surviving both cold and hunger. He must be the one who is making all this noise. Don't be afraid, Elder. Let's go down the mountain to take a look."

Tripitaka has to agree and led his horse down the mountain, they has traveled only a few miles when they came upon the stone box in which where was ineeded a monkey who, with his head [sticking out](#strick-out), was waving his hands [wildly](#wildly) and crying, "Master, why have you take to long to take here? Welcome, Welcome! Get me out, I will protect you on your way to the Western Heaven."
