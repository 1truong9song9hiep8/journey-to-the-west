# SEVENTEEN:<br> *Pilgrim Sun Greatly Disturbs The Black Wind Mountain <br> Guanshiyin Brings To Submission The Bear Monster*

We now tell you that when Pilgrim Sun somersaulted into the air, he so terrified the monks, the dhutas, the young novices, and the attendants at the Guanyin Hall that every person bowed to the sky, saying, "O, Father! So you are actually an incarnate deity who know how to rise on fogs and sail with the clouds! No wonder fire cannot harm you!
