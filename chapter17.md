# SEVENTEEN:<br> *Pilgrim Sun Greatly Disturbs The Black Wind Mountain <br> Guanshiyin Brings To Submission The Bear Monster*

We now tell you that when Pilgrim Sun somersaulted into the air, he so terrified the monks, the dhutas, the young novices, and the attendants at the Guanyin Hall that every person bowed to the sky, saying, "O, Father! So you are actually an incarnate deity who know how to rise on fogs and sail with the clouds! No wonder fire cannot harm you! That ignorant old carcass of ours how dispicatable he was! he used all his intelligence only to bring disaster on his own head"

"Please rise, all of you" said Tripitaka.

"These's no need to regret. Let's hope that he will find the cassock, and everything wil be alright. But if not, I wounld fear for your lives, for that disciple of mine has a bad temper, and I'm afraid that no one of you will escaped him", When the monks hear this, they were all panic-stricken; they pleaded with Heaven for the cassock to be found so that their live will be preserved, but we shall say no more about them for the moment.

We were telling about the Great Sage Sun. having leaped up into the air, he gave one twist of his torso and arrived at once at the Black Wind Mountain. Stopping his clouds, he looked carefully and saw that it was indeed a magnificent mountain, especially in this time of Spring. You see:

*Many streams potently flowing,
Countless cliffs vying for beauty.
The birds call but no man is seen;
Though flowers fall, the tree‟s yet scented.
The rain passes, the sky‟s one moist sheet of blue;
The wind comes, the pines rock like screens of jade.
The mountain grass sprouts,
The wildflowers bloom
On hanging cliffs and high ranges.
The wisteria grows,
The handsome trees bud
On rugged peaks and flat plateaus.
You don‟t even meet a recluse.
Where can you find a woodsman?
By the stream the cranes drink in pairs;
On the rocks wild apes madly play.
Augustly the branches spread their luscious green,
Basking their splendor in bright mountain mist.*

Pilgrim was enjoying the scenery when suddenly he heard voices coming from beyond a lovely grass meadow. With light, stealthy steps, he inched forward and his himself beneath a cliff to have a beep. He saw three monsters sitting on the ground, a swarthy fellow in the middle, a Daoist to the left, and a white-robed scholar to the right. They were in the midst of an animated conversation, discussing how to establish the tripod and the oven, how to knead the cinnabar and refine the mercury, the topics of white snow and yellow prount and the esoteric doctrines of heterodox Daosim, as they were speaking, the swarthy fellow said, laughing "The day after tomorow will be the date of my mother's labor. Will you two genlement pay me a visit?"

"Every year we celebrate the Great King's birthday", said the white-robed scholar, "How could we think of not comming this year"

"Last night I came upon a treasure", said the swarthy fellow, "which maybe called a brocaded robe of Buddha. It's most attractive thing, and I think I'm going use it to enhance my birthday, I plant to give a large banquet, starting tomorow, and to invite all our Dao friends of various moutains to celebrate this garment, we shall call this party the Fesival of the Buddha Robe. How about that?"

Maverlous, Maverlous! said the Daoist, laughing, "First I'll come to the banquest tomorow, and then I'll bring you good wishes in your birthday the day after" When Pilgrim heard them talking about the robe of Buddha, he was certain that they were referring to his own treasure. Unable to suppress his anger, he leaped clear of his hiding place and hight the golden-hooped rod with both hand, shouting, "You larcenous monsters, you stole my cassock. What the Festival of the Buddha Robe do you think you are going to have? Give it back to me at once, and don't try to run away!" Wielding his rob, he struck at their heads. In panic, the swarthy fellow feld by riding the wind, and the Daoist escaped by mounting the cloud. The white-robed scholar, however, was killed by one strocke of the rod, and he turned out to be the spirit of a white-spotted snake when Pilgirm pulled his body over for closer examination. He picked up the corpse again and broke it into a serveral pieses before proceeding deep into the mountain to look for the swarthy fellow, Passing pointed peaks and rugged ridges, he found himself in front of a hanging cliff in a cave dwelling below it you see:
*Mist and smoke abundant,
Cypress and pine umbrageous.
Mist and smoke abundant, their hues surround the door;
Cypress and pine umbrageous, their green entwines the gate.
Flat, dried wood supports a bridge.
Wisterias coil round the ridge.
Birds carrying red petals reach the cloudy gorge.
And deer tread on florets to comb the rocky flats.
Before that door
The flowers bloom with the season
As the wind wafts their fragrance.
Atop the dyke-shading willows orioles sing;
O‟er the bank‟s sweet peaches butterflies flit.
This rustic spot, though no cause for much praise,
Still rivals the3 beauty of Mount Penglai.*

Pilgrim went to the door and found that the two stone doors were tightly closed. On top of the door was a stone tablet, on which was plainly written a large letters, "Black Wind Mountain, Black Wind Cave".

A little demon who stood guard at the door came out and asked, "Who are you, that you dare beat at our immortal cave?"
