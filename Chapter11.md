# Chapter 11: Having Toured(sau khi tham quan) The UnderWorld, TaiZong(Thái Tôn) return to life, Having Presented(sau khi tặng) Melons and Fruits, Liu Quan(Lưu Quân) Marrie Again(cưới lại chồng)
The poem say:

A hundred years pass by like a flowing streams.(Trăm năm trôi qua như dòng nước chảy)<br>
Like /froth and foam = bọt và bọt/ a lifetime(cả đời)'s work now seems.(cả công việc của một đời cứ như bọt biển).<br>
Yesterday faces had a peach's /glow = ánh/ (Khuôn mặt hôm qua có ánh hồng đào)<br>
Today the temples/những ngôi đền/ float up/nổi lên/ flakes of now/những mảnh tuyết/.
Termitis disband-illution then you'll learn.
Cukcook call gravely for your early return.
Secret good works will always life prolong.(Việc lành bí mật sẽ luôn kéo dài tuổi thọ.)<br>
Virtue's not needy for Heaven's care is strong

We now tell about Thaizong, those soul drifted out /trôi khỏi/ of the tower of File Phoenixes (lầu ngũ phụng). Everything was blurred(mờ nhạt) and indistinct(không rõ ràng). It seemed to him that /a company of imperial guardsmen = đội vệ binh hoàng gia/ was inviting him to a hunting party, to which Thaizong gradly gave his consent (bằng lòng) and went off with them. They has journeyed for a long time when suddently the men and horses vanished(biến mất) from sight(tầm mắt). He was left alone, walking the deserted fiels(cánh đồng hoang) and desolate plains(đồng bằng hoang vắng). As he anxiously(lo lắng) tried to find his way back, he heard someone from beyond calling in a loud voice:

Great Tang Emperor! Come over here! Come over here!<br>
Thaizong heard this and looked up, and he saw the man had:

A black gauze cap on his head; 
Rhinoceros horns around his waist.  
His head‟s black gauze hat dangled pliant bands: 
His waist‟s rhino horns displayed plates of gold. 
He held an ivory plaque sheathed in hallowed mist; 
He wore a silk robe circled by holy light. 
His feet put on a pair of white-soled boots 
For treading cloud and climbing fog; 
He grasped by his heart a book of life and death, 
Which determined one‟s fate. 
His hair, luxuriant, flew above his ears: 
His beard fluttered and danced around his jaws. 
He was once a prime minister of Tang: 
Now he judged cases to serve Yama King.

Thaizong walked toward him, and the man, kneeling at the side of the road, said to him: "Your Majesty, please pardon you subject for neglecting/bỏ bê to meet you at a greater distance"

"Who are you" said Thaizong, "and for what reason did you come to meet me?"

The man said: "your lowly subject met in the Halls of Darkness the Dragon Ghost of the Jing River, who was filing suite aganst Your Majesty for having him executed after promising to save him"
